# 🎮 Hold It Together

**Hold It Together** is a chaotic, one-touch mobile reflex game built with **Swift** and **SpriteKit**.

> How long can you hold your nerve and keep the orb from escaping?

---

## 🌀 Gameplay

You must keep the orb under control while chaos increases every few seconds. The orb jitters randomly and grows harder to control as your score rises.

* Keep your finger on the screen
* Steer by **moving your finger around the orb**, not dragging it
* Stay within the safe zone — and **don't let go!**
* Haptic feedback and color changes intensify as chaos grows

---

## 📲 How to Play

1. Tap the screen to begin.
2. Keep your finger held down — **don’t let go!**
3. Move your finger *around the orb* to steer it back toward the center.
4. The longer you last, the faster and more chaotic the orb becomes.
5. Release or leave the screen — and it's game over!
